I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer and Cyber Sciences](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) in Georgia, USA, since 2024. I am also a Graduate Research Assistant in the school.

My research focuses on **distributed algorithms**, with a particular interest in the **consensus problem** in **synchronous systems**.
Currently, my work explores complexity trade-offs in a resource-constrained model called the **sleeping model** (First introduced by [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3382734.3405718)), where the goal is to design a distributed protocol while players (or nodes) choose either to be awake or asleep (active or inactive). Then  we try to provide time-optimal but also highly efficient in terms of energy consumption algorithms. 
I am generally interested in the foundations of theoretical computer science, including complexity theory and the analysis of distributed protocols.

This website serves as a central hub for my research activities. 
You can find a list of my publications, current projects, and occasionally, posts about topics that I find interesting.
