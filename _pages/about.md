I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer and Cyber Sciences](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) at Augusta University. My research focuses on **fault-tolerant distributed algorithms**, with a particular interest in the **consensus problem** in synchronous systems.

My current work explores complexity trade-offs in resource-constrained models, such as the **sleeping model**, where the goal is to design algorithms that are not only time-optimal but also highly efficient in terms of energy consumption. I am broadly interested in the foundations of theoretical computer science, including complexity theory and the analysis of distributed protocols.

This website serves as a central hub for my research activities. You can find a list of my publications, current projects, and occasionally, posts about topics that I find interesting.
