This book focuses on a crucial aspect of distributed algorithms: **locality**. It explores algorithms that operate with only limited knowledge of the network topology, typically within a small radius around a given node.

It provides a deep dive into the communication complexity of distributed problems on graphs, and it is a key text for understanding the trade-offs between the amount of information available to a process and its ability to contribute to a global solution.
