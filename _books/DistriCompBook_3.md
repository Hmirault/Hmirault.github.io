A classic and encyclopedic reference in the field. This book is renowned for its formal and rigorous presentation of distributed algorithms, using the I/O automata model to specify and prove properties of complex systems.

It provides an exhaustive survey of algorithms for both synchronous and asynchronous systems, covering a vast range of problems from mutual exclusion and consensus to data management and fault tolerance. A cornerstone of any distributed computing library.
