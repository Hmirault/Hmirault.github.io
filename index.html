My research focuses on <strong>fault-tolerant distributed algorithms</strong>, with a particular interest in the <strong>consensus problem</strong> in synchronous systems.</p> <p>My current work explores complexity trade-offs in resource-constrained models, such as the <strong>sleeping model</strong>, where the goal is to design algorithms that are not only time-optimal but also highly efficient in terms of energy consumption. I am broadly interested in the foundations of theoretical computer science, including complexity theory and the analysis of distributed protocols.</p> <p>This website serves as a central hub for my research activities. You can find a list of my publications, current projects, and occasionally, posts about topics that I find interesting.</p> </body></html>
